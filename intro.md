# Introductory remarks

I want to get a job and see oppertunity in the field of data science. I feel like more tuned towards data analysis. 

## Structure

### Folders 

I'll probably separate my work by weeks to keep track of my progress. I'm not sure if there is a way to tag topics, so I might come up with a template for describing a file at the top. 

### File names

I'll probably index files starting at 000 just so that things are serialized. While this is probably a bad idea if my work ever becomes significant or I need to refer to it for help, it'll prevent me from wasting time on tagging everything. I can come back to this later.

## Background 

### Python 

At my final semester at the University of Missouri, I studied the CS50P lecture videos to learn some basic python. I've utilized python scripts in my previous jobs to get large projects off the ground, but I relied far too heavily on the assistance of AI and am looking for a more qualifying skillset.

### SQL 

I've also written some basic SQL queries. I remember writing things along the line of 

`
SELECT state FROM orders WHERE id = '######'; 
UPDATE orders SET state = 'ready' WHERE id = '######';
`

### Ruby 

I also learned Ruby around the same time I was doing CS50P video. I remember a lot of correlating things. While I think I preferred Ruby syntactically (is that how you spell it?), I know that it's a skill that I'm not confident I could find a job in. 

## Goals

### Broaden my horizon

I got a degree in electrical engineering, but I feel like there are far more oppertunities for educated individuals remotely programming than there are here locally engineering. Regardless, learning something new is never a bad thing. I completed all the coursework required for a degree in music, and I felt that is has contributed greatly to my ability to tackle hard problems from different perspectives.

### Portfolio

I want to freshen up my github to be more focused on what I can do now than what I did years ago that I'd struggle to replicate immediatly in an interview setting or something like that. 

### Strengthen my career path

I studied engineering, but really anything tech related seems interesting to me. I've been glued to computers since I was a kid, and I'd like to stay glued to them if possible.
