## summary

- execute queries
- insert stuff into tables
- read stuff from tables


## notes

quickly venting

i downloaded stuff and couldnt figure out how to connect to the server because it was done off screen and had to read a tutorial and microsoft likes to be extra wordy, i felt dumb when it was actually really easy and now it looks like setup is complete (which is a lot easier than other set up process, I'm looking at you ruby on windows).

click new database

tables 

new query

okay 

click new query to make a query

we did

`CREATE TABLE NameOfTable<br>
(ID int,<br>
Title varchar(50),<br>
Salary int)<br>
`
execute, show stuff, comment out or delete table

add stuff 

`INSERT INTO NameOfTable VALUES<br>
(1001, 'charaters1', 50050),<br>
(1002, 'charaters2', 50500),<br>
(1003, 'charaters3', 55000)
`
show stuff
