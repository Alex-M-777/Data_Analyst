## summary

- execute queries
- insert stuff into tables
- read stuff from tables


## notes

quickly venting

i downloaded stuff and couldnt figure out how to connect to the server because it was done off screen and had to read a tutorial and microsoft likes to be extra wordy, i felt dumb when it was actually really easy and now it looks like setup is complete (which is a lot easier than other set up process, I'm looking at you ruby on windows).

click new database

tables 

new query

okay 

click new query to make a query

we did

`CREATE TABLE NameOfTable
(ID int,
Title varchar(50),
Salary int)
`
execute, show stuff, comment out or delete table

add stuff 

`INSERT INTO NameOfTable VALUES
(1001, 'charaters1', 50050),
(1002, 'charaters2', 50500),
(1003, 'charaters3', 55000)
`
show stuff



ctrl shift r to refresh less red squiglies
right click show top 1000 rows
